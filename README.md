## Breif Description
POL is an interpreted procedural programming language designed
for an Independent Study at Colorado State University.

## Reasons For Writing
I am building POL as part of an educational glimps into the process
of writing a grammer, lexer, parser, and an interpreter. My goal is 
to learn and take part in, the processes involved in language design 
and implementation.

## Design Process
* Grammer Design 

    The grammer is a LL grammer. This choice was made because
	LL grammers can be easily implemented as a recursive decent
	parser (see below). The BNF for the grammer can be found under 
    [Docs/Grammer.txt](Docs/Grammer.txt)
