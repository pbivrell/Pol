## Breif Description
POL is an interpreted procedural programming language designed
over the course 15 Weeks.

## Reasons For Writing
I am building POL as part of an educational glimps into the process
of writing a grammer, lexer, parser, and an interpreter. I do not intend
to revolutionize anything or even create an overly unique langauge. My
goal is simply to learn the processes involved in language design and
implementation.

## Design Process
* Grammer Design 

    The grammer is a LL grammer. LL was picked in place of LR because
    I planned to implement my own parser and an LL grammer is easily
    extended into a recursive decent parser. The BNF for this grammer
    can be found under [Doc/Grammer.txt]../blob/master/Doc/Grammer.txt
